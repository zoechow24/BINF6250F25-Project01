## Burrows-Wheeler Transform
```{python BWT}
def BWT(string: str) -> str:
  """Function to calculate Burrows-Wheeler Transform for a given string.
    
    Computes the Burrows-Wheeler Transform by creating all rotations of the input
    string, sorting them lexicographically, and extracting the last column.
    
    Args:
        string: The input string to transform.
    
    Returns:
        The Burrows-Wheeler Transform of the input string.
        
    Examples:
        >>> BWT('googol')
        'lo$oogg'
        
        >>> BWT('banana$')

    Computes the suffix array by sorting all suffixes of the input string
    lexicographically and returning their starting positions.
    
    Args:
        string: The input string to process.
    
    Returns:
        A list of integers representing the starting positions of the
        lexicographically sorted suffixes.
        
    Examples:
